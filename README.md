# gıvro's Turkish Traffic Signs
An IV Sign pack containing European-style (mostly Turkish) traffic signs

## What's this?
This is an IV (Immersive Vehicles) content pack aiming to bring European and Turkish signs into the game. The signs will primarily be based on the *General Directorate of Higways' Standards for Highway Traffic Marking (Karayolu Trafik İşaretleme Standartları)*

## How often are new signs going to be added?
I'm a student, so the answer is whenever I have time, anything else would be lying

## Can I suggest signs?
YES! If there's a sign you want to see in the pack, open an issue about it!
